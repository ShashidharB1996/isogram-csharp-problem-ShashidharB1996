# Isogram

**Objective:** Setup a solution with test cases to determine if a word or phrase is an isogram.

An isogram (also known as a "nonpattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.

**Examples of isograms:**
  - lumberjacks
  - background
  - downstream
  - six-year-old

The word isograms, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.

## Note:
- The name of the solution should exactly be `isogram-csharp-problem.sln`
- Don't change the content of files `.gitignore` and `.travis.yml`

## Issues:

Incase of problem raise an issue on https://github.com/nishant-jain-94/isogram-csharp-problem/issues
